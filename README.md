React ToDo App
==============

I'm learning slowly how to use Redux and then React.

Desired result is ambitious for a beginner in React & Redux, I want to turn a ToDo list into an Eisenhower Diagram. 

### To Do ###

- [x] Get Redux working, simple counter app without React
- [x] Configure Babel and Webpack to have object-rest-spread syntax work
- [x] Working tests with Mocha, Expect and deepFreeze
- [ ] Simple To Do App with Redux & React
- [ ] Add Urgent and Important tag options to tasks
- [ ] Next Step = Eisenhower diagram based importance/urgence of tasks
- [ ] Build process for deployment to GH-pages or Surge.sh
- [ ] Log-in functionality to access saved data ?
